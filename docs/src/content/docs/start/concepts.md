Security Group Console is designed to be simple. You create what are called "Security Group Policies (SGP)". These policies are a visual diagram that contain security groups, their rules, and instances they attach to. 

SGP's can manage security groups across your AWS accounts via the AWS assumed role concept. Each SGP is defined within a single VPC. You can not currently nest security groups across multiple VPCs.
